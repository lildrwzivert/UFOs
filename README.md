# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to build an html webpage with an interactive table that filters collected UFO data on multiple criterias.

## Results: 

After clicking on the designated HTML for Dana's webpage, the viewer will be shown Dana's article addressing the topic of UFO sightings and be prompted to use the resources for their own exploration. The data can be filtered on "Date", "City", "State", "Country", and "Shape" of sighted UFO.  
For example, this is what shows when searching by state (Alaska).

## Summary: 
One potential drawback of this layout is that the data sources are not linked. I would recommend adding links and I would also recommend adding a tab for frequently asked questions.
