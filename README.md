# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to build an html webpage with an user-friendly interactive table that filters collected UFO data on multiple criterias based on the viewer's personal exploratory preference. 

## Results: 

After clicking on the designated HTML for Dana's webpage, the viewer will be shown Dana's article addressing the topic of UFO sightings as well as quoted researching prompting the user to engage in their own thought processes. 
At the bottom is a table of all considered data displayed in full with 5 different criteria to filter the data based on user preference. 
The user can enter text within a textbox that will filter the data to the right based on "Date", "City", "State", "Country", and "Shape" of sighted UFO.  
For example, when user searchin for UFO sightings in the state of Alaska, the table would filter to any potential recordings listed within the state of Alaska, as seen below.

## Summary: 
One potential drawback of this layout is that there are no links to the sources used for this data, there is no contact info listed, or extension of features for the user to use.
Recommendations: 
* I would suggest including tabs that can cycle on the homepage from displaying the data to maybe an "About Me" section of the article's author, or links to where user's can continue researching on their own & increase credibility of the webpage.  
* I would also suggest linking any external links to the information provided within each sighting list. Example: "Go to www.UFOstudies.net for more information". A Frequently Asked Questions tab would help in improving the attentiveness to the users.
